The problem here however, is that the continued XXXX dollars per month was never included towards the dept. They just very simply kept my monies without applying it towards the overall dept. Their explanation to me was that since I did not forward the latter XXXX, the XXXX dollars served as interest towards the dept. First, there was no practical reason for them to charge me an increase of XXXX, for missing one payment, and at no time had I violated any rule, regular, or policy of agreement, with this creditor.

2025-06-06,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I filed a dispute with my bank, Truist, on my business credit card for services I had contracted and paid for that turned out to be fraudulent. My dispute case number was XXXX. I singed and paid this contract on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out this was fraudulent transaction in XXXX of XXXX and filed my dispute XX/XX/XXXX. Truist has since denied my dispute for no correct or apparent reason that is applicable to the reason I disputed the charge. This case involves over 400 others and has been escalated to the SEC, FTC, and FBI. This is the letter along with other supporting documents I sent to Truist : This letter outlines my formal dispute and request for chargeback regarding undelivered commercial trucking services I contracted through XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The dispute relates to payments made via XXXX, funded through Truist business credit card totaling {$12000.00}. Although funds were transmitted through XXXX, these payments were in no shape or form a gift. They were for contracted services that were misrepresented, only partially rendered, and ultimately abandoned. 
Please refer to the contract attached. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX 's recent notice claims banking and payment processing issues caused by their subcontractor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, constitute a Force Majeure event. Additionally, stating XXXX XXXX XXXX was never in possession of leased trucks as that was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( their subcontractor ). However, banking issues, subcontractor failures, and business partner defaults are normal business risks, not extraordinary Force Majeure events like natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or government shutdowns, etc. 
My contract is directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their subcontractors ' failures do not absolve them of their direct obligations to me under the contract. Courts consistently hold that internal partner or vendor problems do not excuse nonperformance unless explicitly stated, which is not the case here. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX attempt to attribute blame to subcontractors ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) does not absolve them of liability. Under basic contract law principles, a company can not contract away its obligations by outsourcing to third parties. The risk of subcontractor nonperformance remains entirely with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was directly responsible for fulfilling the services promised to me. 
Therefore, their failure to make the guaranteed weekly payments constitutes a breach of contract and fraud, not a valid Force Majeure event. I respectfully request that this dispute be resolved in my favor. 
This dispute involves a substantial business loss totaling {$12000.00} across my Truist business credit card, as well as an additional {$41000.00} related to other business cards being disputed and tied to undelivered services and mismanagement of funds. Totaling in {$52000.00} as stated in the contract. These funds were provided in exchange for the expectation of truck leasing, weekly operational income, insurance, driver coordination, and full commercial fleet management all outlined in the signed agreement. These services were never rendered in full, and operational updates and income deposits ceased without explanation. 
The inability to recover these funds would cause significant financial harm to my business and undermines trust in secure commercial use of Truist financial services.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,33607,,Consent provided,Web,2025-06-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13938213

Despite repeated requests, the bank has refused to provide any written confirmation of the transaction statusno transaction ID, no confirmation of processing, and no formal acknowledgment of the investigation. 

I was also told that the bank can not locate the transfer and is researching it, but no one has taken ownership of the case or provided a resolution timeline. When I asked for a written summary, even through secure messaging or mail, I was told it is not possible.

These transfers were sent from their XXXX XXXX accounts to my personal account at Citibank. However, Citibank suddenly closed my account and withheld the funds, claiming that receiving money from a third-party XXXX XXXX account violates their policy  even though this is not clearly stated in any terms I was provided.\n\nWhen I asked how to resolve the issue, they informed me I needed to bring the senders of the funds to the branch. These senders were from out of my state, but I traveled to them at my own expense (including flights and hotel stays) to comply. Once we arrived, the bank refused to release the funds and told me to go to the branch where I originally opened my account, located in another state. Again, I paid for additional flights and travel, totaling approximately XXXX.\n\nThat branch also refused to return the funds. Eventually, I was told that if I could provide a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the the people who sent the money to me they will release the funds to me and I did that and after XXXX  months the bank changed their mind again and asked me for a new XXXX XXXX XXXX  from XXXX XXXX and the funds would be released. I submitted the requested document, and Citibank confirmed acceptance and stated that the funds would be sent to me. However, after almost XXXX months, they reversed their position and said they could no longer accept the document from XXXX XXXX They then demanded a new XXXX XXXX XXXX from the original senders banks  which is impossible, since the payments were made from XXXX XXXX not through banks.\n\nIt is clear that each time I complied with a requested solution, the bank introduced a new and increasingly difficult requirement. This appears to be a tactic to avoid returning my rightful funds.\n\nI kindly ask for your urgent assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that Citibank returns the money they are wrongfully holding.\n\nSincerely,  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11209,,Consent provided,Web,2025-05-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13804743

This occurred despite successfully withdrawing an initial {$1000.00} and after calling Citibank support to verify my identity.

After multiple failed attempts to unlock the card and after following every security instruction given, my account was placed under review. It has now been over seven ( 7 ) business days and I have been given no timeline, no resolution, and no contact person for this review. My funds are inaccessible, I live 5 hours from the nearest branch and every customer service representative simply repeats that my account is under review with no meaningful information. This is a critical hardship in a cashless world where we rely on our debit cards to meet daily needs. My overwhelming concern is that my direct deposit from Social Security goes to this account and if they close it, I will not have access. It takes two months to change direct deposit with SSA.

As a consumer, I understand the need for fraud prevention. However, Citibanks actions have effectively frozen my account without just cause or due process. I am being denied access to my own funds and am left in a financial quagmire. I called before hand to prevent this issue.

I request that Citibank : Expedite the account review and unlock my access.

Assign a case manager or point of contact.

Do not close the account if that is their direction for 90 day to allow my to shift my direct deposit.

2025-05-27,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Subject : Urgent Complaint Regarding Wire Fraud and Wells Fargo 's Inadequate Response My wife and I were the victims of a serious case of banking fraud involving our Wells Fargo account. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$25000.00} was fraudulently transferred from our account via a wire transaction. We reported the incident within minutes of its occurrence, yet Wells Fargo has failed to take timely and good-faith action to recover our funds. 

The fraud was initiated through malware posing as a XXXX maintenance worker that infected my wife XXXX XXXX 's computer. At approximately XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, she logged into her Wells Fargo account, at which point the malware initiated an unauthorized wire transfer. Immediately afterward, XXXX was locked out of her account. She contacted the Wells Fargo Fraud Department without delay, and we also promptly filed a report with the FBI. 

Despite multiple escalationsthree to dateWells Fargo has yet to return the stolen funds. Throughout this process, our experience with Wells Fargo has been marked by a pattern of denial, delay, and deflection. Moreover, the bank has repeatedly misrepresented the timeline of events in what appears to be an effort to avoid accountability.

2025-04-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened without my consent or knowledge,"I am writing to formally dispute multiple fraudulent and inaccurate accounts currently reported in my credit file. These accounts were opened without my knowledge or consent, and I believe they are fraudulent. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. Additionally, creditors are required to notify consumers of debt validation within five days of reporting such accounts. This was not done, which constitutes a clear violation of federal law. 

Violations Across All Bureaus : 1. Failure to Notify : Creditors must provide written notification of debts within five days, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1692g. This was not provided, making these accounts illegitimate. 
2. Failure to Ensure Accuracy : Under FCRA 607 ( b ), credit bureaus must ensure maximum accuracy in their reporting. Discrepancies in balances, high credit limits, open dates, and payment histories across bureaus indicate noncompliance. 
3. Failure to Investigate : Under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit bureaus must investigate disputes within 30 days. My disputes remain unresolved despite exceeding the legally mandated timeline. 
4. Failure to Reinvestigate : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) requires credit bureaus to reinvestigate if a consumer disputes the resolution of a claim. My disputes were not adequately addressed. 
5. Failure to Protect Personal Information : The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809 ) requires financial institutions and credit bureaus to safeguard consumer data. This appears to have been compromised. 
6. Identity Theft Protections Ignored : The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) criminalizes identity theft. These fraudulent accounts violate federal protections against identity theft. 
7. Failure to Provide Resources for Identity Theft Victims : Under FTC guidelines ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( e ) ), credit bureaus must provide victims of identity theft with resources and support, including fraud alerts. These steps were not implemented. 
8. State Law Violations : Under New Mexico Compiled Laws 445.65 to 445.67, identity theft is addressed as a criminal offense. These fraudulent accounts violate state law protections.

These reductions took effect immediately, on the same day I was notified. There was no advance warning or lawful notice provided, in apparent violation of the CARD Act, which requires issuers to notify cardholders 45 days in advance of changes that may negatively affect them. 

At the time of the reductions, both of my account balances were already below the new limits. However, this sudden change caused my utilization ratio to spike dramatically, damaging my credit profile. I had not missed any payments, exceeded my limits, or engaged in adverse usage behavior. 

I reviewed the Notices and Letters section of my Citi online account and confirmed that no prior notice was posted, mailed, or otherwise issued before the action was taken. On XX/XX/year>, two days after the reduction, Citi retroactively posted letters dated XX/XX/year>, after the damage had already occurred.

There was some kind of intricate scam going on at this time involving my credit card ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, I had received 3 separate deliveries from my local XXXX store. Each package contained a bag of balloons that I had not ordered. I was especially concerned about this because my name was clearly on each package as though I ordered it. I called XXXX 's customer service and the rep looked up my XXXX account and informed me that there were no such charges on my account. He could not explain why I received the packages and told me not to worry about it because no such orders were on my account. 
See attached photo for reference. 

During this same time, ( not sure if this had anything to do with the above ) I received XXXX small yellow packages from an unknown sender on different days. I only opened the first received package which was a letter that was very vague thanking me for a purchase but not indicating what the purchase was or from whom. I knew it was another scam and assumed it was connected to the XXXX balloons somehow. I think this scammer was hoping I would scan the "" QR '' code on the front of the package to try to figure out who it was from but I declined to do that to avoid going deeper into their scam. Again, I am not sure if this scam is connected to the XXXX scam or just a big coincidence. 
See attached 2 photos for reference.

I am reiterating, I did not make any of the above 3 XXXX purchases. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter regarding Citicard Master Card 's investigation of my above disputes and they included the Merchant 's ( XXXX ) documentation which XXXX claim proves I made the transaction. If a person with any common sense would review this documentation, they would see that the email address and name on the account is NOT mine, the IP address is located somewhere in Georgia ( out of state ) and the contact and telephone information are NOT mine. In addition, it actually says on these documents, that the orders were never fulfilled due to inventory issues and the XXXX merchant is foreign and suspicious since XXXX is claiming this was a local store delivery!
